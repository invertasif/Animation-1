All the 9 required tasks mentioned in page 2 of the specifications document were completed. Though device rotation is not mentioned as a requirement it does appear as a hint. I didn’t allow device rotation because it seemed to me that it would drastically affect the game play negatively. 

The following extra credit tasks were also attempted:
- Use sophisticated Dynamic Animation. For example, you might find a creative way to use the action method in a behavior or use something like linear velocity in your calculations.
- As mentioned above, creativity will be rewarded, especially interesting game-play settings.
- Do some cool artistic design in your user-interface (either by drawing or using images).
- Pausing your game when you navigate away from it (to go to settings) is a bit of a challenge (because you basically have to freeze the ball where it is, but when you come back, you have to get the ball going with the same linear velocity it had). Give it a try. It’s all about controlling the linear velocity of the ball.
